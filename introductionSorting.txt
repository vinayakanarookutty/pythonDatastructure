Sorting algorithms are essential procedures in computer science that arrange elements in a specific order, typically ascending or descending. There are various sorting algorithms, each with its advantages and disadvantages, depending on factors such as the size of the data set, the distribution of values, and the desired level of stability.

Common Sorting Algorithms:
1.Bubble Sort:

Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. Repeats this process until the entire list is sorted.

2.Insertion Sort:

Builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, heapsort, or merge sort.
3.Selection Sort:

Divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element from the unsorted region and adds it to the sorted region.
4.Merge Sort:

Divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element, and repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining.
5.Quicksort:

Chooses a "pivot" element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
6.Heap Sort:

Builds a binary heap from the array and then repeatedly extracts the maximum element and rebuilds the heap.
7.Radix Sort:

Processes the digits of the numbers by counting occurrences of digits. It can be used with numbers, strings, or other data types.
Sort Stability:
Sort stability refers to whether the algorithm maintains the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output. An algorithm is said to be stable if the relative order of equivalent elements remains the same in the sorted output as it was in the original input.

For example, if you have a list of records with the same key value, a stable sort will maintain the order of those records as they were in the input.

Examples:

Stable Sort: Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Bubble Sort
Unstable Sort: QuickSort, Heap Sort, Selection Sort
Why Stability Matters:

In certain scenarios, maintaining the order of equal elements is crucial, such as when sorting a list of people by age and then by name.
Stability is not always necessary, and unstable sorts may be more efficient in some cases.
Trade-offs:

Stable sorts might require more memory or have a higher time complexity.
Unstable sorts can be faster in terms of execution time.
When choosing a sorting algorithm, it's essential to consider not only its efficiency but also whether stability is a requirement for the specific use case.
