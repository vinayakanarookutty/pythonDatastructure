
The average time complexity remains quadratic, as the algorithm performs roughly the same number of comparisons and swaps for a randomly ordered array.
Space Complexity:
Space complexity: O(1) - In-place sorting
Selection Sort sorts the array in-place and doesn't require additional memory space proportional to the size of the input array.
Stability:
Stability:
Selection Sort is not a stable sorting algorithm. Stability refers to the preservation of the relative order of equal elements in the sorted output. Selection Sort may change the order of equal elements during the sorting process.
Adaptive Nature:
Adaptive:
No, Selection Sort is not adaptive. The number of comparisons and swaps remains the same regardless of the initial order of elements in the array.
Summary:
Selection Sort is a straightforward, in-place sorting algorithm with a time complexity of O(n^2) and a space complexity of O(1). While not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets, it is easy to understand and implement. The algorithm is primarily used for educational purposes or for small datasets where its simplicity is an advantage.
